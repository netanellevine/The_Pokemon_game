# The Pokemon game

## Overview
In this task, we were asked to implement a program that simulates the most efficient way for an agent (single or more) to catch pokemon on 
a directed weighted graph. There are 16 stages, 0-15, at the end of each stage you get a grade, the grade is set according to the 
numbers of Pokemon that were caught (the higher, the better) and to the number of moves (the lower, the better).
In addition, we were asked to implement as well a graphic user interface(GUI) that will demonstrate the stage and the user will be able to observe
the whole process.
