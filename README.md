# The Pokemon game

## Overview
In this task we were asked to implement a program that simulates the most effiecient way for an agent (single or more) to catch pokemons on 
a directed weighted graph. There are 16 stages, 0-15, at the end of each stage you get grade, the grade is set according to the 
numbers of pokemons that were catched (the higher the better) and to the amount of moves (the lower the better).
In addition we were asked to implement as well a graphic user interface(GUI) which will demonstrare the stage and the user will be able to observe
the whole process.
